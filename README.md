**RSA Factoring Challenge**
This repository is dedicated to the RSA Factoring Challenge, where the goal is to factorize a set of numbers provided in a file. The main objective is to develop a program capable of efficiently factorizing these numbers, uncovering potential vulnerabilities in their encryption.


**File Descriptions**
**factors:** This file contains the program responsible for factorization.
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that
