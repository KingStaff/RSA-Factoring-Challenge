**RSA Factoring Challenge**
This challenge involves factorizing a given RSA number into its prime factors. The task consists of two parts: Task 0 and Task 1.

**Task 0: Factorize all the things!**
In Task 0, the goal is to factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers. The program takes a file as input, where each line contains a natural number to factorize. The numbers are factorized into the format n=p*q, where p and q are the factors.

**Task 1: RSA Factoring Challenge**
Task 1 is an extension of Task 0. The goal is to factorize a single RSA number, where the prime factors (p and q) are always prime numbers. The program takes a file as input, but this time it contains only one number to factorize.
