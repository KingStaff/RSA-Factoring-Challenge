RSA Factoring Challenge
This repository is dedicated to the RSA Factoring Challenge, where the goal is to factorize a set of numbers provided in a file. The main objective is to develop a program capable of efficiently factorizing these numbers, uncovering potential vulnerabilities in their encryption.

File Descriptions
factors: This file contains the program responsible for factorization.
tests/test00: This file includes the set of numbers that are to be factorized.
